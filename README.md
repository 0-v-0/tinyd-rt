# TinyRT D
TinyRT is a small runtime for D meant to support more limited systems where a GC might not be optimal.  
It's based off `asrd-webassembly`

While WebASM is also a target we aim for, the main focus of this library will be smaller embedded systems.
It is recommended to pair this package with `numem` to get the most out of it.
